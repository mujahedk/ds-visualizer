# DS Visualizer

An interactive, step-by-step visualization tool for classic data structures and algorithms built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

## 🚀 Features

- **Modern UI**: Clean, dark-themed interface with responsive design
- **Data Structure Coverage**: 9 core data structures planned (Heap, BST, AVL, Linked List, Array, Stack, Queue, Hash Table, Graph)
- **Interactive Playground**: Coming soon - step-by-step algorithm visualization
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Testing**: Vitest + React Testing Library
- **Routing**: React Router DOM
